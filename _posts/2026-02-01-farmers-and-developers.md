title: "Farmers and Developers"

About one out of every 5 people who you'd meet in 1860 would have been a
farmer. That was necessary to feed the nation, as the average farmer
could produce enough food for himself and 4 other people. Given the
large market opportunity, entrepreneurs poured attention and talent into
the industry for decades, inventing new processes, mechanical equipment,
tractors, and genetically modified crops. As the productivity of each
farmer increased, the number of farmers sank. Today, you have to go
around to 131 people before you are likely to find one farmer.

A developer trying Claude Code today probably feels a similar range of
emotions as did a farmer being introduced to the combine harvester 150
years ago. Initially, awe and amazement at the sheer ingenuity behind
the tool. And once that sank in, fear and anxiety at what it may mean
for one's livelihood as they foresaw their job being taken by a machine.

Though unlike the market for food which remains relatively fixed per
capita (ignoring the modern tendency to overeat), software has
consistently experienced induced demand as its costs have fallen. That
is, as costs decrease, tools and products that would have otherwise been
cost prohibitive suddenly spring up. In 2007 my team in sophomore EE
class developed a step-counter that would not only track your steps, but
broadcast the results to the Internet as Wi-Fi signal became available,
letting your loved ones follow along with your day, step by step. For
the low cost of \$699 (plus monthly subscription), the TI-83 sized
device could be yours to wear on your waist. Demand at that price point
was demonstrated to be slim. Today, there are hundreds of comparable
products on the market at much lower price points (granted with inferior
designs).

What makes this moment categorically different from the agricultural
revolution is the point of reflexivity. The combine harvester, for all
its ingenuity, did not design better combine harvesters. John Deere
employed engineers who used pencils and slide rules to draft
improvements, which were then manufactured by workers operating
machines. The tools were dumb. The intelligence stayed in human heads.

Claude Code is different. Engineers use Claude Code to develop Claude
Code. The February 2025 release was used to build the capabilities that
shipped in May. The May release was used to build what shipped in
October. Each version is partially authored by its predecessor.

This creates a feedback loop with no clear precedent in economic
history. When a tool can improve itself, the pace of change becomes less
predictable. Agricultural productivity improved roughly 1.5% per year
for seven decades---a steady, plannable trajectory. Software
productivity is lurching forward in bursts, each release making the next
release faster to produce.

The implications are disorienting as the half-life of technical skills
is compressing. In agriculture, a farmer who learned to operate a
tractor in 1950 could still operate one in 1980---the interface remained
stable. In 2023 I spent weeks learning how RAG worked. Today, a rag is
what you used to clean up a mess.

Yet the same loop that destabilizes individual skills also unlocks new
possibilities. Every turn of the crank makes Claude better *and* makes
building new things cheaper. The question isn\'t whether the loop
continues---it will. The question is, what does the world look like
where 1 out of every 5 people you meet is a "developer."
