<p>I'm a co-founder and general partner at <a href="https://www.friale.com">Friale</a> where I invest in early-stage companies across sectors.</p>
<p>I've been a founder for most of my career, building companies in ecommerce, machine learning (old school AI), automotive, and social. I've been through YC three times and exited four companies. I also spent time at Google and served as CTO of a publicly traded media company.
<p>On the other side of the table, I've invested in over 100 startups at the seed stage, with 15 exits, including 2 IPOs to date.
<p>I like working with founders and aspire to be their first call when things go wrong (or sometimes, when they go right too).
<p>I have a BSE in electrical and computer engineering from Duke and an MBA from Harvard Business School.
<p>Based in San Francisco.

<p>Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndalexander/">LinkedIn</a> or email me at my first name at friale dot com.
